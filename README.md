Block Club Calendar
Have you ever come home from work to find your neighborhood filled with cars and visitors for a local market, fair, park event, or giveaway that you didn't even know about and missed? Or made weekend plans to travel only to find out that there was a free family event in your town you missed? The "Block Club Calendar" is the key to making sure you never miss another local gathering. It allows any community member or organization to post notifications on neighborhood events!

My role for this website was to deploy a marketing page with a primary focus of
both getting a reader interested about the website, and testing my abilities when
it comes to HTML and CSS.

The site that I created features semantic HTML text with css styling run through LESS using a compiler. This was used both so i could have the full functionality of LESS with the added benefit of being able to organize multiple less folders for different aspects of my styling. The site links to a seperate page that lists all team members who worked on the project, their roles, and a link to their GITHUB profiles. Both pages are fully responsive and their is even an individual mobile friendly view starting at 500px.
