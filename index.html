        <h1>Block Club Calendar</h1>
        <p>
          Have you ever come home from work to find your neighborhood filled
          with cars and visitors for a local market, fair, park event, or
          giveaway that you didn't even know about and missed?
          <br />
          <br />
          Or have you made weekend plans to travel only to find out that there
          was a free family event in your town that you missed?
          <br />
          <br />
          The "Block Club Calendar" is the key to making sure you never miss
          another local gathering again. It allows any community member or
          organization to post notifications on neighborhood events!

        <h2>Detroit: North End</h2>
        <p>
          With a culture as rich as ours, we believe that everyone should have
          the ability to access some of the most fantastic events that our area
          has to offer.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Block Club Calendar aims to help the public become more aware of
          local events and gatherings, and in turn help grow our community.
          <br />
          <br />
          This is done by creating an account on our website and posting events
          in our calendar.
          <br />
          <br />
          Doing this makes the event more availible for the public to easily
          access. And as a citizen, you can be positive that you won't miss out
          connecting with your community.
